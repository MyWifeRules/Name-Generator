Name Generator (TM)

 Name Generator is a small application for generating sci-fi sounding names for use in games. It can pull real star, planet, and moon names from a list, or generate random ones in either English or Japanese. 

 There is no guarantee that the randomly generated names will make sense, but I have gone to great lengths to make sure they generate in a syntatically appropriate manner.

Name Generator is written in JAVA and works on the command line, or can be integrated into games. Name Generator is featured in the upcoming game "SpaceCase".
